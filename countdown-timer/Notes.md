`<script src="index.js" defer></script>` 

**The defer attribute is a boolean attribute**. If the defer attribute is set, it specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing. Note: The defer attribute is only for external scripts (should only be used if the src attribute is present).
